# UI

## Systems
- modules are dope
- cards are dope
- create design systems
- consistency is king

These are the trends for the future:
- design systems
- design uniquely personalized experiences
- design for change

If you create a system you enable fast iteration. Fast iteration makes success.

## Elements
Interfaces exist of small components, which in turn can be decomposed into
smaller primitives. There are only a few primitives for web UI:
- buttons
- forms
- lists

All other elements are generally supersets of these elements.

## Techniques
- parallax
- card
- media object
- infinite scroll
- smooth scroll
