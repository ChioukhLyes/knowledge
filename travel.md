## booking a plane
- clear cache often, prices are set by cookies
- early vs last minute bookings? no idea which one is best
- most people often already have a cancellation insurance, don't get one twice
- be careful you don't tick extra options when travelling with a cheap company,
this is how they make money
- smaller airports often have better prices
- check if the flight no. you're planning to go on is available somewhere else,
sometimes the same flight is available for less somewhere else

## planning a trip
- Investigate when you want to travel first, off-season can save 80% in costs
- Check out what you can do in the towns you're heading at. Make a day by day
plan.
- Never _just go somewhere_, planning on site is a waste of vacation time.
