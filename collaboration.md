# collaboration
Or how to work well with other people. While staying happy, delivering results
and generally not being perceived negatively.

## The game
You lost it. But aside form that, also a word for {team,company,office}
politics. Because everyone wants things, and politics is just a word that
describes the situation that arrives from that.

## Communicate how the team is fucking up
There's a difference between saying what is true, and saying what is
convenient. Teams where packaging is more appreciated than content are teams
where results are a second rate citizen.

Find ways of telling people all the ways "we" are fucking up without burning
relationships. Make a nuisance of yourself. Become notorious for bringing to
light all the ways "we" are failing.
