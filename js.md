# js
JavaScript, JS, twerkScript, ECMAscript, call it whatever you want. Here are
some neat party tricks you can perform at (including, but not limited to)
birthdays, job interviews and cat cafes.

## Function identifying with ES6 symbols
Checking if functions / objects are equal in JS is typically done with the
`===` operator. This checks if both functions point to the same location in
memory, and then returns a Boolean. In cases where you want to check if a
function or object is of a certain type (e.g. generated by a factory), you're
going to have a hard time. 

What you would want to do is attach a flag to the object to mark it as being a
certain type. Luckily with ES6 you can attach unique, enumerable flags (which 
means they don't show up when iterating over the keys) by using ES6 symbols.

Here's an example:
```js
const sym = Symbol('my unique string')

function generate () {
  const obj = {foo: 'bar'}
  obj[sym] = true
  return obj
}

const nw = generate()
const ot = generate()

nw === ot           // => false
nw[sym]             // => true

// don't ever do this, as if both values
// are undefined, it will also return true
nw[sym] === ot[sym]
```
