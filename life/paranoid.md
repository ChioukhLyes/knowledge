# paranoid

## tin foil hat paranoid
Paranoia about imagined threats. Irrational paranoia. Worry about things that
are not in your control.

## survival paranoid
Healthy paranoia. Worry about things that are in your control. There is nothing
you can do about it, so it makes no sense to worry about it. E.g. flying or
crypto primitives being compromised.
