# presentations
Knowing how to present things is excellent. Lacking good presentation is
catastrophic for your product; having excellent presentation can even make a
shitty product desirable.

## Goals
Conference talks are unidirectional so:
1. Talk about theory
2. Talk about planning / thinking
3. Get people excited
4. Share resources

## Plan d'attaque
1. name the enemy
2. answer "why now?"
3. show the promised land before explaining how you'll get there
4. Identify obstacles—then explain how you’ll overcome them
5. Present evidence that you’re not just blowing hot air

## Writing a CFP
Call for proposals help land talks - they're important.
- What is the talk about?
- Who is the talk for?
- What will people hopefully learn from it?
- Why is it relevant for the specific audience?
- What's unique abou the talk? Why should I watch it?

- start by writing only keywords
- place yourself in the perspective of future audience
- write a brief abstract
- use "you will" instead of "I will"
- ask questions and leave unanswered

## Crafting a Conference Talk
### Wait for an Idea
- Ask yourself: "what is new and exciting about a problem".
- Pitch ideas to friends. Pitch about 2-3 talk ideas a month.

### Write an Abstract
- Writing an abstract has nothing to do with writing a good talk.
- You __will__ get rejected for most proposals.

### Be Accepted
- Celebrate!

### Prepare to Prepare
- Each talk takes about 40-60 hours to prepare.
- Each day can only has about 3 hours of productive work.
- Which means talk preparations need to start one month out.

#### Planning Goals
- Convince the audience that the thing I'm excited about is worth giving a try.
- Provide them with the information needed to get them started on the right
  way.

These two goals pull the talk into different directions. On the one hand you
want to convey excitement & energy. On the other hand you want to provide all
the information needed. Striking a balance is the key to a good talk.

### Arrive at a Rhetorical Structure
- Build up to a strong call-to-action.
- Give attendees concrete tools to try a new approach, or adopt a new
  perspective.

#### Listicle talks
- Audience expects a rapid-fire of "problem-solution" pairs.
- Very useful to convey lots of information in a short time.
- Pad with intro. Pad with conclusion.

#### Creative Narrative
- Structure has the freedom to adopt a myriad of forms found in storytelling.
- Can lead to fascinating directions.
- Greater risk of losing focus.

#### Sharing Personal Experiences
- "Here are 3 simple stories".
- Anecdotes do the heavy lifting.
- Focus on figuring out a clear, grounding theme throughout.
