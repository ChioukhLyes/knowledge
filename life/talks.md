# presentations
Knowing how to present things is excellent. Lacking good presentation is
catastrophic for your product; having excellent presentation can even make a
shitty product desirable.

## Goals
Conference talks are unidirectional so:
1. Talk about theory
2. Talk about planning / thinking
3. Get people excited
4. Share resources

## Plan d'attaque
1. name the enemy
2. answer "why now?"
3. show the promised land before explaining how you'll get there
4. Identify obstacles—then explain how you’ll overcome them
5. Present evidence that you’re not just blowing hot air

## Writing a CFP
Call for proposals help land talks - they're important.
- What is the talk about?
- Who is the talk for?
- What will people hopefully learn from it?
- Why is it relevant for the specific audience?
- What's unique about the talk? Why should I watch it?

- Start by writing only keywords.
- Place yourself in the perspective of future audience.
- Write a brief abstract.
- Use "you will" instead of "I will".
- Ask questions and leave unanswered.

## Crafting a Conference Talk
### Wait for an Idea
- Ask yourself: "what is new and exciting about a problem".
- Pitch ideas to friends. Pitch about 2-3 talk ideas a month.

### Write an Abstract
- Writing an abstract has nothing to do with writing a good talk.
- You __will__ get rejected for most proposals.

### Be Accepted
- Celebrate!

### Prepare to Prepare
- Each talk takes about 40-60 hours to prepare.
- Each day can only has about 3 hours of productive work.
- Which means talk preparations need to start one month out.

#### Planning Goals
- Convince the audience that the thing I'm excited about is worth giving a try.
- Provide them with the information needed to get them started on the right
  way.

These two goals pull the talk into different directions. On the one hand you
want to convey excitement & energy. On the other hand you want to provide all
the information needed. Striking a balance is the key to a good talk.

### Arrive at a Rhetorical Structure
- Build up to a strong call-to-action.
- Give attendees concrete tools to try a new approach, or adopt a new
  perspective.

#### Listicle talks
- Audience expects a rapid-fire of "problem-solution" pairs.
- Very useful to convey lots of information in a short time.
- Pad with intro. Pad with conclusion.

#### Creative Narrative
- Structure has the freedom to adopt a myriad of forms found in storytelling.
- Can lead to fascinating directions.
- Greater risk of losing focus.

#### Sharing Personal Experiences
- "Here are 3 simple stories".
- Anecdotes do the heavy lifting.
- Focus on figuring out a clear, grounding theme throughout.

#### Introductory Talk
- Convince the audience there is a problem in need of a solution.
- Convey all the persuasive aspects of a solution.
- Leave enough questions that the audience wants to engage on their own.
- This takes careful planning, because there are lots of competing priorities.
- An example structure is: 3 problems, a pivot, 3 solutions.

#### Principle Talk
- Start with a principle. E.g. "Let's be more thoughtful".
- 5 problems, apply the principle, 5 outcomes.
- Similar to "Sharing Personal Experiences".

### Search for Visual Metaphors
- Finding visual anchors allows for faster navigating around concepts.
- See also Julia Evans ["How to Teach Technical Concepts with Cartoons"](https://jvns.ca/teach-tech-with-cartoons/)

### Embrace Patterns (aka Modularize)
- Write down all talking points you want to talk about.
- Start grouping the talking points into topics.
- Timebox each topic, and create an ordering.

### Set Up the Presentation
- Start with a fresh document.
- Create intro slide.
- Decide on colors.
- Find a font.
- Illustrate effectively.
    - Simple illustrations can be a great way of condensing complex ideas.
    - Use noun project where possible.

### Seek Feedback
- Helps root out problems / difficulties in the talk.

### Reduce Duplication with Master Slides
- The more you can dedupe work, the faster you can iterate on changes.

### Sprinkle in Variety
- Keep a separate list of tangenial points that came to mind during work.
- Use the points as seasoning to break out of the monotony.

### Tweak, Tweak, Tweak
- Create first draft by using overly wordy text elements (up to 30 words) to
  make points for you.
- Sometimes points are so complex they need lots of wordy slides. Brainstorm to
  find visual metaphors to replace these.

### Embed Screencasts Instead of Live Coding
- Context switching takes time.
- Not each conf is setup to be able to live code.
- Instead of fumbling around, it's better to present a smooth view of how it's
  supposed to be.

### Run Through
- Don't strictly rehearse.
- Instead run through slides a couple dozen times before a talk. At least 3 or 4
  times.
- Whisper the points you want to make.
- The spoken words are crucial to identify the right bridges from one part
  to the other.

### Tools
- Record your screen.
- Use a remote. Cheap is fine.
- Turn on airplane mode for phone & computer.

### Present!
- It's fine to be nervous.
- Preparation is key.
- Combined it can make for an enticing energy.
