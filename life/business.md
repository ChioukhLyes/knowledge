# business
Stuff that's got to do with running a business.

## Invoices
Generate invoices using `HTML` is probably best. The
[wkhtmltopdf](http://wkhtmltopdf.org/) tool is probably the most convenient.
Especially when run from a container.

## Appointments
Make sure they're in the right timezone. Tools like
[calendly](https://calendly.com/) might be helpful.
