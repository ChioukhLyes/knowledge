Perhaps some day you'll have 'em, you better be prepared.

## Sex Ed
1. mature enough to be open about it.. no sneaking around ... if they're not
mature enough to talk to me or their Mom about it, they're not ready.
2. mature enough to wait until they develop full trust in their partners...
start slow and work your way from holding hands and talking to kissing,
touching etc. That gives you time to really know your partner, develop trust
and a measure of real affection not just infatuation and lust (don't get me
wrong.. I'm not putting down lust... it's just not the best emotion for life
decisions).
3. mature enough to understand the need for and to use condoms.
