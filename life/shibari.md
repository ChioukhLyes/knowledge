# shibari
Shibari is Japanese rope tying.

## Suspension
In order to perform suspension, you need to start off with a harness. Harnesses
tie around the body and provide proper points of attachment.

Kimono ties are probably the most prolific of ties. Ties hands behind back.
Makes for dramatic perfomance.

## Ties / knots
### single column tie
Like tying a shoe lace. Ideal to wrap around something.

### double column tie
Wraps around two columns, ties them together in the center. Ideal to wrap
things together. It can be tied down to finish off a piece, but it can also be
used to loop back to.
