# project management

## 70 / 20 / 10 rule
- 70% of the time should be spend on things that happen now
- 20% of the time should be spent on things that are next
- 10% of the time should be spent on things spent on things for later

## 80 / 20
80% of the value comes from 20% of x. Find out what x is and cut down the rest.

## sprint planning
Can use GH issues for this.
- sprint goals
  - human readable goal of the sprint
- sprint participants
  - @mentions
- sprint deliverables
  - per person
  - triage section (anyone can pick these up)
