## Simplicity
- complexity is a constant
- complexity is objective
- simplicity is subjective
- complexity is how many operations need to be performed
  before achieving the goal.
- tesler's law of conservation of simplicity: Every application has an inherent
  amount of irreducible complexity. The only question is who will have to deal
  with it.
