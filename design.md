## Fonts

## Simplicity
- complexity is a constant
- complexity is objective
- simplicity is subjective
- complexity is how many operations need to be performed
  before achieving the goal.
- tesler's law of conservation of simplicity: Every application has an inherent
  amount of irreducible complexity. The only question is who will have to deal
  with it.

## Easing functions
### in / out
On the web `ease-in` is slower at the start. On the web `ease-out` is slower
at the end. `ease-in-out` combines both eases.

### acceleration
```
sine   1 Sine acceleration
quad   2 Quad acceleration
cubic  3 Cubic acceleration
quart  4 Quart acceleration
quint  5 Quint acceleration
expo   6 Exponential acceleration
```

## reasons to learn design
- bad design reflects poorly on your work
- clients will prefer pretty over bland, even if they're not designing
- being versatile will allow you to fill positions that demand versatility

## the krav maga of design
1. light comes from the sky
2. black and white first
3. double your whitespace
4. learn methods of overlaying text on images
5. make text pop -- and unpop
6. only use good fonts
7. steal like an artist

### light comes from the sky
Non obvious, very important. Elements higher on the screen should be lighter
than those lower on the screen.

### black and white first
It allows you to worry about less, initially. Analogous to 'mobile-first' it
constrains your decisions, allowing you to focus on the harder problem first.

### double your whitespace
Whitespace is the default. Taking away the whitespace is a conscious decision.
Be zen about it.

- put space between your lines
- put space between your elements
- put space between groups of elements

Analyze what works

## Mobile first
Allows you to tackle the hard problem first, what information matters, before
making it fit on a bazillion pixel screen.
