## installation
`weechat` is the best CLI client as it integrates very nicely with bitlbee. To
enable plugins, we must set some flags during compilation. On OS X do:
```txt
$ brew install weechat --with-perl --with-python
```

## commands
```txt
/part <msg>   # leave a channel
/away         # set yourself as away
```
