## Booking a plane
- clear cache often, prices are set by cookies
- [skyscanner](www.skyscanner.com) is presumably pretty good to compare prices
- early vs last minute bookings? no idea which one is best
- most people often already have a cancellation insurance, don't get one twice
- be careful you don't tick extra options when travelling with a cheap company,
this is how they make money
- smaller airports often have better prices
- check if the flight no. you're planning to go on is available somewhere else,
sometimes the same flight is available for less somewhere else
