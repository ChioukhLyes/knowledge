## Velocity
Biz people value estimates. We value biz people being happy and trusting us.
Having accurate (data driven) estimates and transparency is great. What I think
works best is:
- have clear cards of chunks of stuff that need to happen
- give values to each card (not time, time sucks - fibonacci can work)
- create a list of stuff that needs to be done today, and work down the list
- create a list of stuff that's been done today, post this at the end of the
  day / the next standup
- create a list of stuff that needs to be done tomorrow, and as you hit blocks
  write down todos for the next day
