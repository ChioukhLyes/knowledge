# mock meat
Meat is nice but definitely unsustainable. Instead of buying poopy products at
the store, it's better to make your own delish ingredient substitutes for your
favorite dishes that won't be available in a few years.

## mock eel
works well in sushi / sea dishes.

### ingredients
- 20 dried shiitake mushrooms
- 2 qts. peanut oil for frying
- 2 cups cornstarch
- 1 tsp. peanut oil
- 1/2 tsp. garlic, minced
- 1 tsp. ginger, minced
- 3 Tbsp. scallions, sliced thin on a bias
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 2/3 cup organic sugar

### method
- Rehydrate the shiitake mushrooms in boiling water until tender.
- With scissors, cut the mushroom caps into earthworm-shaped strips.
- Heat the 2 qts. peanut oil to 190Â°C.
- Coat the shiitake strips with cornstarch and fry until golden. Let drain as you prepare the sauce.
- Heat a wok over medium heat and add the 1 tsp. peanut oil.
- Add the garlic, ginger, and scallions and cook, being careful not to burn the garlic and ginger. 
- Add the soy sauce and the sugar. Adjust the flavor if too sweet or too salty.
- Add the shiitake strips and toss until well coated and most of the sauce is absorbed.
